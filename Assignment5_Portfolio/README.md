# Assignment 5: Portfolio | Dec 7
## [Personal Portfolio](https://sripranav9.github.io/CommunicationsLab/Assignment5_Portfolio/index.html)

### Description
This is a personal portfolio of Sri Pranav Srivatsavai. The website hosts all the major assignments of this class - Communications Lab, some Design projects, and some personal information. The website is divided into the following categories:

- Home
- Comm Lab
- Design
- About
- Contact Me

The major sections - Home, Comm Lab, and Design have the projects with transition effects when the user hovers over the projects. Apart from these specific elements, the website is fully interactive and provides a good user experience through the color, shadow, transition elements feedback throughout the catalogue of elements. 

**Software used:** Visual Studio Code (HTML, CSS, and JS)

### Process
- I started with the home page, comm lab, design and so on with other pages.
- Basic elements were taken from the first website which I considered as a template for major desings throughout.
- There were a few problems that I encountered during the process as bringing some classes from previous projects might involve collisions with respect to the same names used, etc. which took quite some time to debug.
- Overall, I took an entire day to finish the website leaving the images for the the home page.
- The images were later added and the website stands finished.


### Reflections
- It is very satisfactory to see our work in real-life hosted on the web, thanks for GitHub. 
- Debugging is always a pain, but taking breaks and coming back the code helps. 
- As this is the last assignment for this class, I looked back through all the assignments while pasting the links for them in the website, and it is interesting how I started off knowing almost nothing and I atleast have a basic idea of how things work on web now, besides audio, video and many other crucial elements.
