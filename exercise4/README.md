### Description
When I think of my hometown, the city of Hyderabad, one of the major hubs of IT in India, I can think of an average middle-class worker going for a job in the morning. The soundscape starts off with a person walking out of the door, and suddenly exposed to the sound of traffic outside. They then proceed to a chaiwala shop to get some tea and quickly head out. Almost in no time after they are out again in the traffic, they enter their workplace and they can hear the sounds of phone calls, people moving around with chairs, sounds of papers, etc. denoting the environment at the workplace. They then begin typing to log in to their system and start their work.
