# Exercise 2: Illustrator and Photoshop | Oct 3
## <a href="https://sripranav9.github.io/CommunicationsLab/Assignment1_30MFF/" target="_blank">Website to host the designs</a>

### Description
This is a website to host the .svg file type illustrations made using Adobe Illustrator and .jpeg file type images made using Adobe Photoshop. In the website you can also click the media which takes you to the google drive where you can download the original file. As always, I have added my contact details in the footer for people to contact me with any questions. 


### Reflections
I loved creating the hover effect using the layer property for the media (illustrations and the photoshop version) and I believe I can implement these designs I've learnt so far in my final project.
