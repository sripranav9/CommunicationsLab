# Assignment 2: Comic | Oct 12
## [The Falcons](https://sripranav9.github.io/CommunicationsLab/)

>Group: Basil, Liza, Mohid, Pranav

### Description
The website hosts a short comic titled 'The Falcons'. The Falcons (inspired from The Marvels) are a group of 5 superheros at NYU Abu Dhabi. Each hero has their own special powers. When clicked on the heros, the website automatically scrolls down to the story of that partcilar hero which shows their powers and a short conversation. The 5 heros are responsible for different problems students usually face on a dialy basis:
  - **Library:** Finding material in the library
  - **Academics:** Difficulty in solving problems
  - **D2:** Running out of mealswipes
  - **City Knowledge:** Lack of knowledge with regards to exploring the city
  - **Athletics:** Exploring the machines in the gym

Although the characters do not exatly provide solutions to those problems, each pane is a combination of stress relieving comments that are curated to engage the reader and actually throw a light on these problems with a funny lens to remove the negative thoughts about the same. We aim to achieve a state where the reader is fully engrossed in the setting, is able to relate to some of the problems, and can find some common connections. Some of the comic principles per McCloud that we incorporated in this comic are as follows

Coding Languges: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Software: Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, picsart.com


### Process

#### First Meeting
- We met as a team to decide what we will be working on for this assignment. 
- We brainstormed various themes and something that struck to us was that related to the series: Miss Marvel.
- Using that as the inspiration, we planned to develop stories for the topics (problems) mentioned above.

#### Second Meeting
- We met to finalize the story and have the dialogues and characters ready.
- Everyone pitched in some great creative stories for each topic and we had to stick to some of the main ones that everyone could relate to and was logsitically possible to represent in the comic.
- We came up with number of panes for each story, the background for each pane (background setting) – time of the day, number of people required, etc., exact dialogues of miss marvel and the student(s) in the comic pane. 
- Once we had an idea of how the panes looked like, we could then get the green light to work with wireframing the website, illustrations, comic bubbles, and the backgrounds as a whole.
- We then scheduled the next meeting for a work session to create illustrations, take pictures and edit them for the background, wireframe the website, and begin coding. 

#### Third Meeting
- We divided our work where 2 out of the 4 of us went to click pictures and recreate the setting that we planned on having for the comics. The other 2 of us worked on the illustrations and wireframing the basic layout. 
- To create the background in a comic setting, we explored different websites that can convert a specific image to cartoonish/comic style image and we found a good website that does it for us taking less time (although Photoshop was always something we had in mind) is [picsart](https://picsart.com). An exmaple of the before and after can be found here:

- **Major change to the story** during this process is that we wanted to mimic 'The Marvels' and not just 'Miss Marvel' so we came up with 5 different characters for each story.
- We then proceeded with the illustrations of the characters. We found some of the illustrations on online stock illustrations tools which helped us create our illustrations. We have taken some of them and changed the colors of 6-7 layers atleast for each character separately as they were very detailed. Each illustration took a great amout of time to be in the expected color doing the right action (in the correct position) for the specific pane we require them for.
- While the illustrations were being created and shifted to a new document with each character on a different layer (in .svg – for interaction on the website), the wireframe was finalized and all the photos were being converted to the comic style images. The code for the layers of SVG files was copied for the use in HTML.
- Speech bubbles with a decided font were ready to be placed into Photoshop for the final comic pane.

#### Fourth meeting
- The basic version of the website was ready with the illustrations and some animations on hover. 
- We presented our progress in the class for feedback. 
  
#### Fifth meeting
- Added navigation bar to the website, attention to some intricacies, font styles, and colors of the website was also a part of this crictical analysis. 
- The comic panes are in progress where the illustrations of characters and speech bubbles are being added to the comic style background in Photoshop.
- Final touches to rest of the things while the comic panes are being prepared. 

#### Sixth meeting
- The comic panes are ready and agreed upon by everyone (we loved them!). These comic panes are added to the website where the expected illustration takes place (user clicks on the character and the website moves to the relavant comic pane)
- The website is finally working as expected!

### Reflections:
It was very interesting for us as IM and CS majors to work on this project collectively, each bringing their own expertise and creativity. We were on track with our internal deliverables throughout and made practical projections of the work to be completed each day and the final result to be acheived. Overall, we loved working with each other as we set clear goals and divided the work appropriately. 
  
Some challenges we faced were with regards to the illustrations, it would've been a little difficult in terms of the time we have to create different versions of one character instead of the 5 we did in this assignment. Searching for the right font also took a long time as we needed the best possible font to convey the messages to our audience.
