### Description
The website hosts a short comic titled 'The Falcons'. The Falcons (inspired from The Marvels) are a group of 5 superheros of NYU Abu Dhabi. Each hero has their own special powers. When clicked on the heros, the website automatically scrolls down to the story of that hero which shows the story and power of that particular hero. The 5 heros are responsible for different problems students usually face on a dialy basis:
  - **Library:** Finding material in the library
  - **Academics:** Difficulty in solving problems
  - **D2:** Running out of mealswipes
  - **City Knowledge:** Lack of knowledge with regards to exploring the city
  - **Athletics:** Exploring the machines in the gym

Although the characters do not exatly provide solutions to those problems, each pane is a combination of stress relieving comments that are curated to engage the reader and actually throw a light on these problems with a funny lens to remove the negative thoughts about the same. We aim to achieve a state where the reader is fully engrossed in the setting, is able to relate to some of the problems, and can find some common connections.
