# Exercise 3: Scroll Animation | Oct 10
## <a href="https://sripranav9.github.io/CommunicationsLab/exercise3/" target="_blank">Link to the Website</a>

### Description
This is a website made for the assignment to learn scroll animations using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Using these animations as a medium, the website
hosts a short story of two young siblings â€“ Ben and Gwen. 

### Reflections
I wanted to include a parallax effect in the first/main section but it was time-taking so I didn't finish it. But it was fun learning about it, I will surely continue learning about the same to include this in the final portfolio if possible.
Furthermore, as we are progressing in this class and learning a wide variety of things, using HTML as a basis to talk about them is enabling me to get acquainted with HTML, CSS, and JS better and better each day,
