# Assignment 1: Website
## [Coco and Ostap](https://sripranav9.github.io/CommunicationsLab/Assignment1_30MFF/)

### Description
This website is for the 30MFF shot by 3 students from the class: Communications Lab (IM-UH 1011) at New York University, Abu Dhabi. The task was to finish shooting 
a video and edit it within 30 minutes. The video must have a story, a meaning, and should make sense (something that is not totally random). Our team came
up with this idea as it is common for university students and we used our soft toys (featured as Coco and Ostap) to depict what we wanted to convey – which is 
academic pressure and stress in university and how friends can help us cope with that. In the film, Coco and Ostap are worried about their studies, they are confused
and nothing might be going right in their lives, hence they decide to meet up – showing how friends play an important role during this period. To host this film, 
we needed to create a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The link to the website can be found [here](https://sripranav9.github.io/CommunicationsLab/Assignment1_30MFF/) 
or in the title above. The website is a landing page with all the necessary sections in one main homepage – main title, the video (embedded using vimeo), 
team of directors, and a 'contact me' option for visitors to shoot an email to me. The website is in a dark setting to show this problem at large common to many 
students across the globe.
